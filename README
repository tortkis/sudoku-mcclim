Overview:

  This is a collection of sudoku functions for Common Lisp:

  * sudoku.lisp ............. core functions
  * sudoku-control.lisp ..... functions for playing games
  * sudoku-ui-mcclim.lisp ... GUI for McCLIM

  The program can generate and solve any size of sudoku ((m*n)^2),
  where m and n are the number of rows and columns of a block,
  respectively, and the number of total rows/columns is m*n.  It can
  generate large sizes of sudoku such as (4*4)^2 or (5*5)^2 if the
  number of masks is small.  However, since the algorithm is simple,
  it takes too long time for tables larger than (3*3)^2 if mask number
  is large.  I created this program for my son to play with smaller
  sudoku such as (2*2)^2 or (3*2)^2.

Usage:

  * Put a symbolic link to sudoku-mcclim.asd in an ASDF system
    directory.
  * load ASDF.
  * start GUI.
    (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'sudoku-mcclim)
    (sudoku-mcclim:run)

Notes:

  * This program uses images included in Gimp: Logos of "Basic I" &
    "Comic Book".

  * As you see, the images are very primitive, except that came from
    Gimp ("Number(Comic)" in Style and Check messages).  You can add
    your images for cells.

    - Create a directory under images.

      $ cd images
      $ mkdir <your-image-dir>

    - Put 100-pixel x 100-pixel xpm images under the directory, at
      least 4 of them, whose names are "s4-<image-name>.xpm".

      $ cp <somewhere>/s4-*.xpm <your-image-dir>/

    - Run resize-sudoku-images.lisp.  It creates images for sudoku
      with sizes of 6^2, 8^2 and 9^2.

      $ ./resize-sudoku-images.lisp <your-image-dir>

    - Add images to Style menu.  For example, if you created
      s*-cat.xpm, s*-dog.xpm, s*-monkey.xpm and s*-bird.xpm under
      images/animals directory:

      (sudoku-mcclim:add-image
       '("Image(animals)" "animals" ("cat" "dog" "monkey" "bird")))

      then, "Image(animals)" will appear in Style menu.
